**About**

This project was developed as part of an individual study assignment for the Complex Data Structures course at Saxion University of Applied Sciences.

**Track Manager Application**
The Track Manager is a console-based application that manages and analyzes the Dutch railroad network, including some international connections, using custom data structures and algorithms such as Linked List, HashMap, Binary Search Tree, Stack, Queue, Depth-First Search, Prim’s, and Dijkstra’s Algorithms. It allows users to retrieve station information by code or name, filter stations by type, calculate the shortest route between two stations, and determine the Minimum-Cost Spanning Tree (MCST) for full network connectivity.



- Documentation is available at `doc/Documentation.md`. 
- The application can be run from `src/app/Application.java`.
- To run the tests, please ensure JUnit 5.8.1 is added to the classpath. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3b18aa9-7aac-4ca5-a1d6-e4f99355b339)
